The time to failure of a product is well described by the following probability distribution: $f(x) = 0.1e^{-0.1x}, x \geq 0$. If time is measured in hours, what is the probability that a unit fails before 100 hours?
    \begin{align*}
        &r.v. \ X \equiv \text{the time that a unit fails}\\
        &X \sim exp(\beta = 10)\\
        &P(X <= 100) = \int_{0}^{100} 0.1e^{-0.1x} = 0.99995_{ \ \#}\\
    \end{align*}
